Chiffre Vigenere Encryption
======================
This is the first BETA version of this software. There are known bugs, however.
If you have some characters in the input field and you delete the key completely, it will cause the application to crash.
You may highlight the key you want to remove and type in a new one instead.
______________________
The algorithm of the encryption is in Encryption.cs.

I just noticed that I confused the names Caesar Cipher and Chiffre Vigenere. The name of this software will be changed very shortly.
